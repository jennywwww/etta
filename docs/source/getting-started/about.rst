About the ExoFOP Python API
===========================

The ExoFOP Python API consists of a series of lightweight wrappers around
the PHP functions which are offered by the Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program for TESS (ExoFOP-TESS).
You can read about the underlying PHP functions in the `ExoFOP-TESS documentation`_.
