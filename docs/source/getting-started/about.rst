About the ExoFOP Python API
===========================

The ExoFOP Python API consists of a series of lightweight wrappers around
the PHP functions which are offered by the Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program for TESS (ExoFOP-TESS).
You can read about the underlying PHP functions in the `ExoFOP-TESS documentation`_. 

The package contains two modules:

* php_wrappers
    Contains a wrapper for every PHP function provided by ExoFOP-TESS, except functions under the "Files" heading (i.e. download_files, download_files_zip, download_filelist, download_tag_files, download_tag_files_zip).

* helpers
    Contains helper functions used by php_wrappers. Provides a more flexible and extensible way to call ExoFOP-TESS PHP functions.
